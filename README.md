## Development

![Deno](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deno-222222?style=for-the-badge&logo=Deno&logoColor=70FFAF)

This project is built with [Deno](https://deno.com/) and
[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

**Why?**\
[placekitten.com](https://placekitten.com/) is down. üò¢ And so I needed to
either a) find an alternative kitten image placeholder service or b) make my own
kitten image placeholder service.

The kitten images are from Unsplash. This service relies heavily on hotlinking
to Unsplash images via redirects and using their `w`, `h`, and `ar` query
parameters to resize the images.
